## Assessment
Hey there!

Thank you so much for taking the time to check this out — we appreciate your time.

We'd like you to show us a bit of what you can do by completing a short exercise. It's nothing major, and should not take you long, but we'd like to give you room to blow us away.
We require that you make a submission within a specific time frame, whilst leaving you room to improve on the first submission over an extended period. 
Just to be clear, you do not have to spend too much time on it. We just want you to deliver simple, clean and, idomatic code in a well organized form.

## How to do the exercise

Fork this repository to your github profile, do the exercise and then send us a link to your repository in an email message to veteran@en-powered.com with the subject "``mle-test1``".

You can have as many commits as you would like, but after completing the exercise
to our basic specifications, commit your code with the commit message:

"``Submission1``"

This would allow us know which one of the commits you want to be evaluated on.
You should do this by noon on Wednesday.

After this, if you want to show us more of what you can do by improving on your
first submission, work on it some more and then make another commit with the
message "``beyond-the-call``"

You can do this any time before midnight on Thursday. We will not
consider any submission after midnight on Thursday.

## The Exercise

We’d like you to build a classifier that identifies a successful or unsuccessful Kickstarter project.

Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity and merchandising. The company’s stated mission is to  “help bring creative projects to life.” Kickstarter has reportedly received more than $1.9 billion in pledges from 9.4 million backers to fund 257,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.

In this repository, you will find zip files with the appropriate datasets.

  - kickstarter-dataset-1.zip
    - kickstarter-dataset-1.csv
  - Kickstarter-dataset-2.zip
    - kickstarter-dataset-2.csv
    
## Key specifications and constraints

- You are free to use a machine learning framework of your choosing

- Ideally, your solution and data exploration are to be presented in a Jupyter Notebook, with appropriate markdown explaining the steps you are taking and the choices you are making throughout. Alternatively, this can be submitted in a separate write-up.

- To fulfill the initial requirements of the task, the model does not need to be deployed. However, the solution must show that the model has been called and is able to make the appropriate classification.

## Other considerations

- While a deployment solution is not required to fulfill the initial requirements of the task, deployment is a crucial component of any machine learning pipeline. If you would like to improve your solution after the initial submission, feel free to try deploying your model or submitting a write up detailing the deployment approach that you feel would be suitable for your solution.

## Asking questions

We are happy to answer questions but would prefer that you make assumptions and move forward. Later, if asked, stand by your choices and defend them. If you do choose to ask questions, please send an email to veteran@en-powered.com eh!
